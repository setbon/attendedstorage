      <h4>Storage &amp warehousing safety and security</h4>
 
    
<p>If it can't fly, we can't store it! If your goods do not meet ATA safety regulations, we are most likely not the right place to store them.</p>

<p>Flammable or explosive gases will not be stored. Items we will store (in cases) include panels, screens, monitors and other. Liquids nor flammables will not be accepted.</p>

<p>If it belongs in a museum, we won't store it!</p>

<p>If two strong pairs of hands cannot carry it down the stairs in the event of an elevator outage, we won't store it!</p>

<p>If loss or theft of your item means the end of your business, we won't store it!</p>

<p>Our committment is to secure your equipment along with our own to the best of our capabilities, however our agreement will disclaim any responsibility for damage or loss.</p>

<p>We aim to provide a useful, reliable service. We will conduct business in good faith while remaining alert and performing due diligence. To do so, we must be confident that while you entrust us with your goods, life factors that may be outside our control won't mean the end of your nor our business. Once we have secured a space and start generating attended storage revenues, we plan to reinvest our proceeds in a state of the art video surveillance system. Later we will consder an Access Control System, Intrusion Detection System and Fire Detection.</p>

<p>We will suggest third party insurance providers whom you will be able to contact to insure your goods separately.</p>

<p>In short, we cannot bear the responsibility of your first born!</p>
