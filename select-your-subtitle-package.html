<h2>Budget Subtitles</h2>
<p>
  If you have your own (in-house) translation team and are looking for a way to create inexpensive&nbsp;subtitles,&nbsp;our 
  <strong>Budget Subtitles</strong>&nbsp;may just be what you need.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  You'll have to be okay with the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>linguistics (incl grammar and spelling) are your&nbsp;responsibility</li>
  <li>no Italics or other marking will be added&nbsp;for off-screen speech</li>
  <li>all subtitles will be positioned on the bottom of the screen</li>
  <li>screen graphics will not have&nbsp;subtitles.</li>
  <li>subtitles may cross shot changes</li>
  <li>positioning: subtitles may overlap with on-screen graphic text such as title cards</li>
  <li>font size & color: White or Yellow&nbsp;â€“ size between 26-30)</li>
  <li>max character per line 37-40*</li>
</ul>
<p>
  While a max of 40 characters per line is recommended for optimum reading it &nbsp;takes more work and requires professional subtitle translation experience to do a good job editing the subtitles while still retaining the meaning. It also helps to use a professional subtitling software to simulate the subtitles and be able to split and merge subtitles as needed based on timings and breakpoints. However, if you prefer to make it easier for your translators and your subtitles are intented for internet use only based on a 16:9 aspect ratio, we can prepare a template that allows up to 50 characters per line.
</p>
<h4>
workflow</h4>
<p>
  step 1: You provide us with the English transcript. You also supply the original English video per
  <a href="http://iprobesolutions.com/language-services/subtitling/receivables">our video encoding specs.</a>
</p>
<p>
  step 2: Using your transcript, iProbe times (spots) the in and out times of each subtitle and ;outputs an MS Word Export template featuring a text block for each subtitle: English on top, and space for the translation underneath per below screenshot that shows the first three subtitles of what is a complete <a href="http://attendedstorage.com/downloads/word%20export%20template%20generated%20script_sample.doc">ms word export example with English and Japanese subtitles</a>.

</p>
<p>
  step 3: Your translator team inserts the translation of each subtitle into the MS Word Export Template per our <a href="http://attendedstorage.com/downloads/SubtitleTranslationGuidelinesForCLients.txt">Subtitle Translation Client Guidelines</a>
</p>
<p>
  step 4:&nbsp;Once the templates are completed for each language, you send us the translations which we then&nbsp;import into our subtitling system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  step 5: We import each completed translation into our system and perform comprehensive technical quality control:
</p>
<h5>QC Timings</h5>
<ul>
  <li>minimum separation</li>
  <li>non-fixed duration</li>
  <li>invalid time-codes</li>
  <li>minimum/maximum duration</li>
  <li>out of sequence</li>
</ul>
<h5>QC Text</h5>
<ul>
  <li>max 2 lines</li>
  <li>blank subtitles</li>
  <li>blank rows</li>
  <li>subtitle not on base line</li>
  <li>double spaces</li>
</ul>
<h5>Deliverables</h5>
<p>
  Once the subtitles have passed technical QC,&nbsp;iProbe outputs XML subtitle files for import into Final&nbsp;Cut&nbsp;Pro.
